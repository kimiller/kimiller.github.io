# Bitcoin Faces Pressure: Fed Official States "Premature to Consider Rate Cuts," What's Next for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced downward pressure on Friday, dropping from around $43,000 to a low of $42,000, influenced by hawkish comments from John Williams, a key monetary policy maker at the Federal Reserve.

John Williams, a prominent official of the New York Federal Reserve, appeared on CNBC's "Squawk Box" program, stating that "it is premature to consider rate cuts at this time."

This contrasts sharply with earlier dovish remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week and the Fed's latest economic and rate forecasts, which predict a decrease in inflation and three rate cuts in 2024.

During the meeting, Powell indicated that he believes interest rates have peaked, and there might be room for rate cuts in the future.

This dovish sentiment triggered a strong rebound in the U.S. stock market at the time, with a sharp decline in government bond yields, a slide in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), and a rapid increase in bets on up to six rate cuts next year.

Bitcoin also witnessed an uptick during this period.

## Fed's Communication Misstep?

However, Williams' comments on Friday suggest that the Fed is aware of a miscommunication in its message to the market following the recent dovish market response.

In an interview with CNBC, Williams added that the Fed's current primary focus is to ensure that its policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.

He emphasized that if necessary, the Fed must be prepared to raise interest rates again.

This aligns closely with the information the Fed conveyed to the market for most of 2023, before announcing a dovish shift on Wednesday, which excited investors.

Looking ahead, after realizing the miscommunication during Wednesday's meeting resulted in a more dovish market response than expected, Fed officials may attempt to counterbalance the dovish market bets, as Williams did just now.

However, as noted by Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, the decision on whether the Fed will ease policy in March next year will be determined by the next three core PCE inflation reports, not the current Fed comments.

John Williams' remarks on CNBC this morning will not decide whether the Fed will ease policy in March. The next three core PCE numbers will play a decisive role.

## Bitcoin's Future Outlook

The hawkish Fed message led to a bearish takeover on Friday, bringing Bitcoin's latest price down to around $42,000.

This places Bitcoin in the midpoint of the range of $40,000 to $44,000 this week, a 6% drop from the yearly high of about $45,000 reached last week.

Long-term price forecasts may still be bullish, with expectations that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in 2024 will stimulate institutional adoption, the Bitcoin issuance rate will halve in March next year, and the potential slowdown in U.S. financial conditions (i.e., Fed rate cuts).

However, as the optimistic expectations for a Bitcoin ETF are likely already priced in, and with no significant news expected in the coming weeks, coupled with the market grappling with conflicting Fed information, the timing of future rate cuts becomes somewhat uncertain, potentially leading to short-term setbacks for Bitcoin.

The bear market will focus on crucial short-term support, namely the 21-day moving average (currently at $40,900) and whether it can hold above this week's low (slightly above $40,000).

If not, a fallback to $38,000 is possible, a previous strong resistance area and the location of the current 50-day moving average.

However, it is expected that long-term Bitcoin investors less sensitive to short-term market fluctuations will seize any opportunity to purchase BTC at prices below $40,000.
