The Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a pause in interest rate hikes, but what excited the market even more was the latest interest rate dot plot from Fed officials. The dot plot indicated three interest rate cuts in 2024, significantly boosting optimistic expectations for rate reductions in the market.

## Key Points:

- The Federal Reserve held its final FOMC interest rate decision meeting early this morning, deciding to pause interest rate hikes as expected.

- The latest interest rate dot plot from Fed officials suggests three interest rate cuts in 2024, ranging from 0.75% to 1.00%. The baseline interest rate is projected to decrease from 5.25% to around 4.6%, slightly higher than the current two-year Treasury yield of 4.4%.

- Market sentiment is even more optimistic than the Fed's projections. The dot plot previously indicated a 2024 rate estimate of 5.1%, now revised down to 4.6%, significantly uplifting market expectations for interest rate cuts.

- This positive outlook has led to remarkable gains in the U.S. technology sector, with Apple stock reaching a historic high. The cryptocurrency market also witnessed a notable recovery, with Bitcoin briefly rebounding above $43,000.

## Market Outlook:

- The U.S. inflation narrative is nearing its conclusion, with only a final stretch remaining to alleviate inflationary pressures. The path to a soft landing seems achievable, and restrictive interest rates are expected to return to a "neutral rate" by next year.

- Optimistic sentiments are anticipated to support cryptocurrency market prices until mid-January next year when the impact of inflation subsides. Post-inflation, market trends will be influenced by various factors, making predictions more challenging than being solely driven by interest rates.
