Microsoft's video editing tool, Clipchamp, has recently introduced some new features, including AI auto-creation and AI text-to-speech. Users can simply upload photos and videos, choose a video style, and AI will automatically generate professional-level videos. In addition, Clipchamp has added content library tags to help users easily find and add materials. Users can also record audio narrations for videos up to 30 minutes long and use AI-based text-to-speech functionality for voiceovers.

## Microsoft's Clipchamp Introduces New Features: AI Auto-Creation and AI Text-to-Speech

Microsoft acquired Clipchamp in 2021, a user-friendly web-based video editing tool. Subsequently, Clipchamp was integrated into Microsoft 365 personal and family subscription plans. Recently, Microsoft expanded Clipchamp to the Microsoft 365 Business edition plan and added the ability to import video clips from Xbox consoles.

In the latest update on the Microsoft 365 Insider blog, Microsoft outlined some new features recently added or soon to be added to Clipchamp. One of the new features is "Auto Creation," and the Clipchamp website provides more information about this AI feature: simply upload your photos and videos, choose a video style, and let our AI create a professionally looking video, turning the events of your life, travels, or holiday memories into attention-grabbing videos on social media.

Clipchamp also introduced a content library tag to help users find materials from both free and paid libraries and incorporate them into their videos. This tag includes currently popular and recently used content, as well as content categorized by type. Users can also input specific content they're looking for, such as holiday-themed videos, images, or audio clips.

Starting from early December, Microsoft began rolling out a new feature for personal accounts, allowing Clipchamp users to record audio narrations for videos up to 30 minutes long. The blog highlights two advantages of this feature: "Creating narrations and adding automatic subtitles is much faster than creating text from scratch. With a separate narration track, you can update and edit narrations without having to edit the entire video."

Finally, personal account users can now use AI-based text-to-speech functionality for voiceovers, and users can change the language, voice, emotion, and pitch of the AI voice in the application. This feature will be added to Microsoft business accounts in early 2024.
